# Using Core ML for semantic image segmentation

Use the [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) framework for image segmentation using optimized open source models. This sample demonstrates how to use the DEtection TRansformer model for object detection and panoptic segmentation.

For more information about the app and how it works, see
[Using Core ML for semantic image segmentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/Using-Core-ML-for-semantic-image-segmentation) in the developer documentation.
